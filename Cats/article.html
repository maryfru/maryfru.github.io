            This page was created to show you how cool Cat’s really are, mine in
            particular :)

          <p>
            I am a huge animal lover! And if you are reading this, maybe you are
            to.
            <br />
            So why Cat’s? I mean, do not get me wrong. I do love all sorts of
            animals. But let us stick to the topic and leave it to Cat’s... at
            least for now.
            <br />
            Not only are they adorable (because seriously, they are so cute),
            they are also fiercely independent, curious, and loyal — and can
            make amazing lifelong companions for you or your family.

            <p>
              The adventure starts October 2020, when I adopted Shiva from the
              Organization

              Found on a busy street in Apahida (Cluj-Napoca [RO]) he was only
              4-5 weeks old at the time. From day one Shiva was brave and
              curious, never scared of anything. He loves food. No, like
              really... He LOVES it! Actually he would stare you down in order
              to get a piece. He is watching every bite you take, because maybe
              just maybe you will give in and share some. Whenever there are
              visitors, Shiva is lurking in the distance. Checking if the people
              are worthy of him. If yes, then he will come out to great them. If
              not, then he will stay in his hiding place.

              Loving and affectionate. Hates strangers from all her heart. Best
              hunter out there.
            </h3>
            <p>
              So I already had Shiva for a couple of weeks and I could not get
              rid of the feeling that he would need a friend. Someone to play
              with and interact the way animals do, not like humans and animals
              do. This is when I saw a Facebook post that someone found a kitten
              and can not keep it, therefore would like to put it for adoption.
              This is how I met Belphegor! She was so scared at first. Was
              hiding under the couch and came out only at night. Gladly it did
              not took her long to get used to us. I still think that Shiva has
              helped Belphegor conquer her fear of the new place. So after
              Belphegor got friends with everyone in the household she became a
              Lovebug. She also likes to talk to you, so ask her a question, she
              will reaspond.

            <h2>Grumpy</h2>
            <h3>
              Independent and strong. Was very sick and sadly died in 2022. I

            </h3>
            <p>
              Her story truely is a sad one and to be honest this is one of so
              many reasons why it is important to adopt. Grumpy was one of many
              Cat’s which ware treated at
              <a href="https://www.nuca.org.ro/" target="_blank"
                >Animal Welfare NUCA.</a
              >
              Initially she was found on the streets and brought to NUCA for
              sterilization. However the veterinarian found her with all sort of
              problems causing her to stay hospitalized for over one year. As my
              boyfriend is working at NUCA he got very attached to her, so we
              took her home for further treatment, as nobody else wanted her. We
              gave her the opportunity to escape the hospital and the feeling of
              family. Sadly her illness took a turn for the worse and she
              eventually died. To be honest, having Grumpy was hard, as she was
              a special need animal. However, I do not regret having her, she
              was amazing! I still think back with joy about you. But also with
              sadnes over what happened to you, I love you!

            <h2>Lucy</h2>
            <h3>
              Silly and gentel. Favorite sport would be curtains climbing. Also
              called spider Cat.
            </h3>
            <p>
              I found Lucy on July 2022 in my garden. Up to this day I do not
              know how she got there and why she stayed, but I am glad she did.
              Belphegor and Shiva ware really sceptical about her at first. You
              can not imagine the hissing and beating poor Lucy received from
              them. But she did not gave up and after some weeks Shiva finally
              accepted her. So now that Shiva is her buddy she just had to
              pursuit Belphegor somehow. But Belphegor is very hard to get. This
              mission is still in work, however it is looking good. Lucy is
              really a big fan of both Shiva and Belphegor, but oddly does not
              like humans. She still seems to be shy around me and my boyfriend
              but I am sure that she will lose up in time.

            As every cat owner knows, nobody owns a cat. They just accept the

                Did you know that cats have an extra organ that allows them to
                taste scents? Or that they developed meowing as a way to
                communicate exclusively with humans? Clearly, there’s more to
                our little feline friend than meets the eye. Below you can find
                some amazing facts about Cat’s that might brighten your day.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Cat’s are believed to be the only mammals who don’t taste
                  sweetness.
                </li>
                <li>Cat’s have 230 bones, while humans only have 206.</li>
                <li>
                  Cat’s have the largest eyes relative to their head size of any
                  mammal.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cats’ collarbones don’t connect to their other bones, as these
                  bones are buried in their shoulder muscles.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Tiger shares 95.6 percent of its genome with the domestic
                  Cat.

              <p>
                Did you know that grapes and raisins, as well as onions, garlic,
                and chives, are all extremely harmful foods for Cat’s. Grapes
                and raisins can cause kidney failure — although the reasoning
                behind that isn’t clear. Meanwhile, onions, garlic, and chives
                wreak havoc on your Cat’s gastrointestinal system and can cause
                anemia.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Cat’s can spend up to a third of their waking hours grooming.
                </li>
                <li>Cat’s live longer when they stay indoors.</li>
                <li>
                  Despite popular belief, many cats are actually lactose
                  intolerant.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Cat’s are fastidious creatures about their “bathroom.” If you
                  have more than one Cat, you should have one litter box for
                  each.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The Cat’s grooming process stimulates blood flow to the skin,
                  which regulates body temperature and helps them to relax.

              <p>
                Did you know that when Dog’s wag their tails, they may be
                expressing happiness. But this is not the case for Cat’s! When a
                Cat wags her tail, it is her way of warning you that you are
                getting on her last nerve.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Cat’s may yawn as a way to end a confrontation with another
                  animal. Think of it as their “talk to the hand” gesture.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If a Cat approaches you with a straight, almost vibrating
                  tail, this means that she is extremely happy to see you.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Meowing is a behavior that Cat’s developed exclusively to
                  communicate with people.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Whiskers are also good indicators of a Cat’s mood. When a Cat
                  is scared, the whiskers are put back. But when a Cat is in
                  hunting mode, the whiskers are forward.

                  Cat’s find it threatening when you make direct (staring) eye

                Did you know that Cat’s like to sleep on things that smell like
                their owners, such as their pillows and dirty laundry (ick! But
                somehow cute).

                <li>
                  Cat’s love to sleep in laundry baskets, too, because they are
                  basically hiding places with peep holes.
                </li>
                <li>For some reason, Cat’s really dislike citrus scents.</li>
                <li>Cat’s often attack your ankles when they are bored.</li>
                <li>
                  Cat’s groom other Cat’s and sometimes people in a ritual
                  called allogrooming.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Thieving behavior is not uncommon among Cat’s. They will often
                  grab objects like stuffed animals, feather dusters, and other
                  things that remind them of prey.

                Did you know that kittens in the same litter can have more than
                one father. This is because the female cat releases multiple
                eggs over the course of a few days when she is in heat.

                <li>
                  Cat’s can drink sea water in order to survive. (In case you

                <li>
                  Cat’s have contributed to the extinction of 33 different
